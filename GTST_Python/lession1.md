# its all about python

***what is programming language***

it is language which helps to communicate with computers {they are not able to understand human language }
- a program is an algorithm expressed in a programming language.

## evolution of l/O {input / output}
- early in the history of computing, programs were submitted on punch cards with all the data they required and executed together with other programs that used the same libraries. output was to a line printer. 

# #Generation of Computers

1. first generation  #punch cards
2. second generation #programming started here with Assembly
3. third generation #BASIC, #COBOL, #Pascal, #Fortran, #c , c++, 
4. fourth generation python, SQL, Matlab
5. fifth generation

$$ Types of programming languages
- computers understand binary (0/1), humans dont understand this 
- **A. low level programming language** 
- this langugae are more like machines but lots of effort pepopkecan understand them
- **B. high level**
- they are more close to human langugae
- **C. medium level**
- langugaes between low level high level they combine both$$
#### how do high level languages work ?
- as we saw earlier we have said that computers know only binary's, and if we code with high level languages how do computers understand us?
